                CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) the HTML elements you want to style.<br />

                We can divide CSS selectors into five categories:<br />

                Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)<br />
                Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)<br />
                Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)<br />
                Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element)<br />
                Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)<br />
                This page will explain the most basic CSS selectors.<br />
