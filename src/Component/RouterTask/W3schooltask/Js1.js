                A JavaScript function is a block of JavaScript code, that can be executed when "called" for.<br />

                For example, a function can be called when an event occurs, like when the user clicks a button.<br />

                You will learn much more about functions and events in later chapters.<br />

                JavaScript in head or body<br />
                You can place any number of scripts in an HTML document.<br />

                Scripts can be placed in the body, or in the head section of an HTML page, or in both.<br />
            </div>
        </>
    )
}
